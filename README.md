## Hello and Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

**I go by lyric0x10, but you can call me Lyric.**

### About Me
- ðŸ”­ **Current Project**: Iâ€™m actively developing a Lua obfuscator designed to enhance code security and protect intellectual property. It's an exciting challenge that pushes the boundaries of Lua manipulation and protection.
  
- ðŸŒ± **What I'm Learning**: I'm diving deep into **luac**, the Lua bytecode compiler, exploring its inner workings to understand how Lua executes code at a lower level. This helps me fine-tune my obfuscation techniques.

- ðŸ’¬ **Ask Me Anything**: Whether you're curious about Lua, obfuscation, or programming in general, feel free to reach out. I'm always happy to discuss and share insights.

- ðŸ“« **How to Reach Me**: The best way to contact me is through Discord. You can find me at **`lyric0x1`**.
